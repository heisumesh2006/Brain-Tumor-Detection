This project is an AI-powered system that detects brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It automates the classification of brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories, aiming to assist doctors and radiologists in early and accurate diagnosis.

📌 Features
✅ Classifies MRI images into "Tumor" and "No Tumor"

🧠 Built using CNN for high accuracy in image classification

🧪 Trained and tested on real MRI datasets

📊 Visualization of training accuracy, loss, and predictions

🧾 Simple and clean code for reproducibility

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI images organized into two folders:

yes/ – images with tumors

no/ – images without tumors

(You can find similar datasets on Kaggle or other open-source medical datasets platforms.)

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
Open the .ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run all cells to train and test the model.

📊 Results
Training Accuracy: ~98%

Validation Accuracy: ~96%

Model shows clear separation between tumor and non-tumor classes.
